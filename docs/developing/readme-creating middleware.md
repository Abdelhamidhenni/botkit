# Botkit middlewares

The functionality of Botkit can be extended using middleware functions. These functions can plugin to the core bot running processes at several useful places and make changes to both a bot's configuration and
the incoming or outgoing message. Anyone can add their own middleware to the Botkit documentation, [for more information please read this.](#have-you-created-middleware)


#Have you created middleware?
We would love to hear about it! [Contact the Howdy team](https://howdy.ai/) to be included in Botkit documentation, or [submit a PR on this documentation](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-storage-firebase/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
